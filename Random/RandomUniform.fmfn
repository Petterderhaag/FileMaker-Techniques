 * =====================================
 * RandomUniform ( minimum ; maximum )
 *
 * PURPOSE:
 *		Creates a random continuous value between "minimum" and "maximum". When
 *		called repeatedly, RandomUniform returns values that are uniformly
 *		distributed between minimum and maximum.
 *
 * RETURNS:
 *		A number representing a random variate from a uniform distribution
 *		between minimum and maximum.
 *
 * PARAMETERS:
 *		minimum: A number specifying the lower bound for the distribution.
 *		maximum: A number specifying the upper bound for the distribution.
 *
 * DEPENDENCIES: none
